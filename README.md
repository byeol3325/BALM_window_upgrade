  <b>BALM window version</b>
</p>

We modified BALM's code to run on **Windows** and improved time performance by **30 percent** through additional optimizations (additional parallel operations). üòÅ

### Reference paper: [Efficient and Consistent Bundle Adjustment on Lidar Point Clouds](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.08854)
### Reference code: [BALM 2.0](https://github.com/hku-mars/BALM)

We made the code run in a Windows Visual Studio environment. You can use any version of visual studio **19** or **22** you want. üòÅ
